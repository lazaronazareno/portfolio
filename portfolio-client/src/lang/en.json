I had the opportunity to work on different projects that allowed me to sharpen my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as the use of various frameworks such as React, NextJs and a bit of Angular. Additionally, I have experience in developing web applications that require integration of a server with databases (NODEJS, JAVA, MYSQL).",
